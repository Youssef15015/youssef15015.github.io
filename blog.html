													<h3>January 5th 2021</h3>
													<blockquote> The purpose of this first comment is to introduce this blog into the world. You can expect a long chain of analysis concerning relatable daily experiences, occurances throughout history, and recent noteworthy or recognized events. I am striving to finish this website to publicize my identity in an approachable fashion, and relying on the medium as another resource for job applications. I hope to either work at the library as a teaching instructor or substitute at the middle and high schools. More interestingly would be attaining an internship at a tech company. I suspect that my next post will be after securing a job to talk about the shortcomings of modern day education, and how it is failing society to its doom.   </blockquote>

												<h3>March 22 2021</h3>
												<blockquote> Is there a better way to measure time than the last time the github servers were backed up? Doesn't it seem useful to back-up the entire existence of your data to ensure it hasn't been altered. Three days from today marks the start of <a href="https://scientistrebellion.com/"> the Scientist Rebellion: "We are scientists, calling for a climate revolution"</a>, on March 25th. The mission is dedicated to non-violent and civil disobedience in higher education, with the intention of getting academics to commit to their own warnings concerning political influences (specifically dangers to the environment such as climate change). My personal favorite non-violent rebellion is jay-walking. That's the source of every Egyptian's adrenaline rushes (of course, over there: it is just crossing the street). I will later post a message directed towards some of the authoritive figures in American High Education. The future looks promising for RAP. Today is a curcial day to mark the maximum potential of my thesis. </blockquote>

												<h3>March 27 2021 (Scientist Rebellion)</h3>
												<blockquote> My department has evaluations of teaching assistants by Professors at my institution due by the 29th of March. I would say that is either a furiously pathetic and an inappropriate reaction to very serious concerns, or just a plant to identify professors that are not quite here with us. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A6n_xqRGw48IPhea7cEYCnveytlfuFVLoldYNRIY7MY/edit?usp=sharing"> Here</a> is a presentation illustrating the key concepts illustrated by Scientist Rebellion's movement. I then leave this message to those who are killing Physics institutions: "Rotting away in a lifeless hell hole, studying all there is about our constituets, maybe even the whole Universe, yet somehow incapable of seeing beyond your momentumental ego of nothingness. Claim to be an independent mind, yet worship some meaningless assigned symbols on a piece of paper. Have that many people really cited you? In your dome of collective madness. Your hateful lifeless life is not only your own, for you are sucking it from whatever you own. Your stubbonerness of insantiy and archaic regims are the enemy of life. Oh False Deity, it is better to die life sucker than to suck it from all around you, or just watch yourself burn with the rest of the world as you pride yourself in delusions. Teaching Physics without teaching thought is nothing more than teaching Nazi thought." I will later add a new link on my webpage that researches different non profit corportations that are dedicated to planting Trees.</blockquote>
