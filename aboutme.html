										<h1>More About me</h1>

													<h4>Background</h4>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>I grew up in Cairo up until the eleventh grade of school with a heavy nourishment of American media. I had the chance to speak with a wide variety of people from all different types of backgrounds. The education system catered little to scientific understandings, but lavished in literature and history. I finished my 12th grade in Omaha, Nebraska, and attended Rutgers for 5 years, and have settled in Ames, IA. I attended a summer abroad program in Paris at Rutgers, and additionaly visited many European countries. I am currently pursuing a masters degree at Iowa State University. </p>
													<h4>Education</h4>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span> At Rutgers,  I was inclined to welcome every possible learning opportunity and digested a diverse academic education. I took 201 credits of class over the span of five years, participated in the chess, philosophy, aeronautics, and physics clubs, joined two research teams, and held multiple teaching positions. I decided on continuing studying physics, instead of the original engineering track I started, due to the noticeable difference in the appreciation of the aesthetics of math that broadened my horizons to previously inconceivable measures. I also added a french major, after finding french literature and history fascinating. I am a firm believer in Richard Muller’s philosophy of learning broad subjects during one’s undergraduate that could “trigger a life-long learning in the breadth of fields that will likely prove invaluable to [one’s] career” (Quora). I hope the Spring of 2021 to be my last semester at Iowa State University, for which I will graduate with a masters degree with the acquired skill of perseverance. At Iowa State, I had plenty of resources of high level data analysis performed by the <a href="https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/">VERITAS</a> colloboration. My final semester will be dedicated to independent research of simulating cosmic particle acceleration under Dr. Curt Struck. </p>
														<h4>Hobbies</h4> 
														<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span> I play at a class C level in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_rating_system">chess</a>, but I am ascertain that I will reach class A when I find the time to play more tournaments. I enjoy all sorts of games, and grew up playing many different types of them! I enjoy walking, exploring, and meeting new people and cultures. Other than the conversations, I enjoy comparing different countries through their parks. I am most impressed by parks in Milan and Amsterdam. My favorite parks in the US are central and Ada Hayden Park in New York and Ames. I enjoy finding the most productive and helpful methods of using technology, and espicially enjoy the advancements technology is having on teaching and colloborating. I choose soccer has my favorite sport as an exervise, and enjoy watching the tactics and skills of the game. My favorite reading medium has changed from novels to articles.</p>
														<h4>Personal Statement</h4>
														<p> I believe every decision and every matter warrants caution and ethical behavior. I have a firm belief in prioritizing education for the benefit of society and will strive to contribute by any means. </p>
